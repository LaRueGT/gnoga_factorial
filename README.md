I wrote this program from the help of Pascal's excellent Gnoga tutorial.

Gnoga is a user interface library for the Ada language, it uses some clever
jquery to enable user interfaces through the browser. I'm really impressed with
it so far. It feels somewhere in the middle of a GUI toolkit like gtk and a web
framework like flask. The library abstracts the web stuff away and allows you to
write up your UI in all Ada, though html/js/css are sure to come in handy later.

The tutorial was written in French and assumes a linux environment. With the
help of google translate, the comp.lang.ada newsgroup, the #Ada IRC channel on
freenode, and much experimentation I am maging some headway on following this
guide as an english speaking wondows user. I hope to produce an English version
of the excellent tutorial, and fill in some of my own advice for the parts I
found challenging.

Ada has been a joy to program in so far, I researched it out of curiosity a few
months ago and have been tearing my way though books and websites ever since.
There is not a lot of tutorial style information on the language, which has
forced me to deduce, experiment and research more than I have in a long time. It
has been a rewarding experience.

I hope to familiarize myself with Ada and Gnoga even more, I may even re-make my
personal site with it and try some embedded projects with it.
